# MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems

This repo contains labs and notes for the MIT graduate level [ course ](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/general.html) on distributed systems, taught by Robert Morris.
I initially started to audit this course as a companion to reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) by Martin Kleppman.
